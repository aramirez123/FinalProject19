# It's Due!

Here are a few friendly reminders for everybody:

1. Your work is due at 11:59 PM tonight, January 27th.
2. You must hand in:
  * Your code (as long as it's pushed to GitHub in the master branch, you're fine)
  * Your flowchart (PDF file in your repository)
  * Your works cited (you can create a .md file or write it up in whatever tool you want and export a PDF, but either way it should be in your repository)
3. Your code needs comments
4. If you just share files with me, **I will not see them while grading** and will think you haven't done your work. If I can't access it from your repository, it doesn't exist
